My name is Daniel Zint and I am currently affiliated as Assistant Professor / Faculty Fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences under supervision of [Daniele Panozzo](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/daniele.html).
My research is centered in geometry processing, more precisely mesh generation for numerical and graphical applications. I am interested in all parts of the mesh generation pipeline: pre-processing and simplifying input data, generating triangle and quadrilateral meshes, post-processing with smoothing and topological optimization. During my PhD, I focused on the automatic generation of block-structured meshes that are used in ocean simulations based on the shallow water equations. Currently, I am focusing on meshing offset surfaces.
