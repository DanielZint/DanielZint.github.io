**Abstract:** We present an algorithm called discrete mesh optimization (DMO), a greedy approach to topology-consistent mesh quality improvement. The method requires a quality metric for all element types that appear in a given mesh. It is easily adaptable to any mesh and metric as it does not rely on differentiable functions. We give examples for triangle, quadrilateral, and tetrahedral meshes and for various metrics. The method improves quality iteratively by finding the optimal position for each vertex on a discretized domain. We show that DMO outperforms other state of the art methods in terms of convergence and runtime.
